# CS6360 - Assignment 1


# Script References
In addition to the screenshots and directions from the Assignment 1 Instructions.pdf, we used the following sources for coding on the following issues:

**GetKeyDown**
  - for tab button to turn the light different colors
  - for keys 1 and 2 to switch between rooms
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html


**Skybox**
- https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UseSkybox.html
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/7shm13/how_does_a_skybox_work/

**Choosing Random Game Objects to light up**
- https://answers.unity.com/questions/589808/choose-random-gameobject-from-array.html

**Trigger Lights**
- https://forum.unity.com/threads/trigger-lights-in-unity.162560/
- https://forum.unity.com/threads/turn-on-light-with-ontriggerstay.532668/

We have both contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
